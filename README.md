# HackBrowser

HackBrowser is built with Electron (formerly Atom Shell), which enables building cross platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HackBrowser uses Electronâ€™s <webview> API to simulate tabbed browser. Since every part of code written on top of Electron is editable, it is super easy to customize the browser in any way you want or need.
