## HackBrowser

HackBrowser is a cross-platform, hackable browser written in Javascript. HackBrowser is built with Electron (formerly Atom Shell), which enables building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Since every part of the application's code is visible, customizing the browser in any way is possible. 

**This project is in heavy development.**
